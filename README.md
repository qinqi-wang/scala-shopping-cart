# scala-shooping-cart
An implementation of a shopping cart code kata using function programming principles in Scala

The original kata can be found [here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/).
Since the original kata is more of a thought experiment, the idea of this repo is to tackle a few of the ideas listed in the kata.
